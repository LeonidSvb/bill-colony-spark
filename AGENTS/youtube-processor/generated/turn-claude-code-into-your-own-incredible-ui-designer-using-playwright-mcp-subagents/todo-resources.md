# TODO & Resources: Playwright MCP Setup

## ‚úÖ Action Steps

### Phase 1: Setup (This Week)
1. **Install Playwright MCP** in Claude Code
   ```bash
   claude mcp add playwright npx -- @playwright/mcp@latest
   ```
2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - Open browser with: "Use playwright mcp to open a browser to example.com"
   - Verify visual feedback loop works
3. **Document Setup Process** for team replication

### Phase 2: Integration (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Enhance Content Repurposer Agent** with visual capabilities
2. **Create Visual Design Standards** for all deliverables
3. **Test with PDF Guide Creation** (first use case)
4. **Implement Visual QA Layer** for client materials

### Phase 3: Scale (Next Month)
1. **Train Team** on visual-aware workflows
2. **Create Case Studies** showcasing quality improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Key Commands
```bash
# Install MCP
claude mcp add playwright npx -- @playwright/mcp@latest

# First use (may need explicit reference)
"Use playwright mcp to open browser to [URL]"

# After setup
"Take screenshot of current page"
"Navigate to [URL] and capture visual"
```

### Configuration Files
- **MCP Config:** `~/.claude.json` (tracks project-specific MCP servers)
- **Browser Settings:** Visible Chrome window for easy authentication
- **Session Persistence:** Cookies maintained during session

### Important Considerations
- Browser window opens visibly (not headless)
- Authentication can be done manually during session
- Works with structured data (accessibility tree), not screenshots
- Deterministic results vs pixel-based approaches
