Client Content Strategist Subagent - Complete Brief

## Overview
A reusable subagent that loads client-specific packs, analyzes source content (YouTube/transcript/long-form text), proposes channel-agnostic opportunities scored by ICE, and produces items one-by-one with human approval. Every run includes a newsletter version.

## The Two Packs (Preload for Each Client)

### 1. Client Strategist Pack
Purpose: Who we're speaking to, what change we're driving, and which offers/CTAs to use.

Required contents:
- ICP: titles, company size/geo, disqualifiers
- Top 3-5 pains and jobs-to-be-done
- Offers and CTA links; when to use each
- Common objections with one-line responses
- Why-now angles for the next 60-90 days
- POV do/don't statements (2-3)
- Constraints/no-go claims
- Primary success metric (e.g., meetings, opps)
- Review owner and update trigger

Format: ≤1,200 words, bullet-heavy, stored at /Clients/[Client]/Packs/01-Strategist-Pack-v1.0.md

### 2. Brand & Messaging Pack
Purpose: How we sound and what story we tell.
Note: You'll provide all details for this pack and keep it under 1,000 words.
Format: Stored at /Clients/[Client]/Packs/02-Brand-Messaging-v1.0.md

## Session Configuration

### Parameters (set at start)
- Client: [Name]
- Allowed channels: LinkedIn text post, Carousel, Infographic, PDF guide, Blog post, Quote graphic, YouTube description
- Always include: Newsletter version
- Cap per session: 3 items (default)
- Output naming: [ClientCode]-[YYYYMMDD]-[Channel]-[TopicSlug]

### Operating Constraints (state explicitly)
- No external API calls or autopublish
- Never mix client data; this session is for [Client] only
- Max tokens per draft: 1,500
- If unsure about brand fit, flag for human review
- Check Published table to avoid repeating hooks/angles from last 30 days

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Load packs and confirm
"Load and internalize these packs for [Client]:
1. Strategist Pack: [paste or link]
2. Brand & Messaging Pack: [paste or link]

Summarize in 8 bullets covering ICP, pains, offers, voice, messaging approach, and any constraints. Ask me to confirm before continuing."

### 2. Ingest source content
"Source content: [YouTube link or transcript]
Confirm runtime/length. If transcript lacks timestamps, ask for 3 high-contrast moments with rough times."

### 3. Analysis pass (no drafting)
"Extract 10-15 key moments with timestamps under these headings:
- Golden Nuggets (insights worth repurposing)
- Pain Points (map to our narratives)
- Success Stories/Expert Quotes
- Technical Deep Dives (merit visual formats)

For each, note the ICP segment it serves and relevant messaging pillar."

### 4. Opportunity Finder
"Propose content opportunities across allowed channels. For each opportunity include:
- Working title/hook
- Recommended format
- Target ICP segment and pain addressed
- ICE score (Impact 0-10 +2 BOFU, Confidence 0-10, Ease 0-10)
- 1-2 line rationale

Sort by ICE total. Do not force a count. Ask which items to produce (remind me of cap)."

### 5. Selection and hook tuning
"I'll select items (e.g., 'Produce #1, #3, #6').
For each selected item, propose 2-3 alternative hooks/titles.
Wait for hook approval before drafting."

### 6. Item-by-item production

For copy-based items (LI, blog, newsletter):
"Draft [item] using brand voice. List any verify/soften risks. Pause for edits."

For design-based items (carousel, infographic, PDF):
"Create designer brief:
- Purpose and audience
- Core message
- Page/slide outline (title + 2-3 bullets each)
- Visual cues and chart prompts
- Brand colors and logo placement
- Copy blocks to paste
Pause for edits."

After each: "Approved? If yes, log as completed and say 'Next' to continue."

### 7. Newsletter production (always)
"Create standalone newsletter:
- Subject (5-7 words) and preview text (35-60 chars)
- Lead story (answer-first, ties to source)
- 1-2 sections summarizing approved items
- One CTA matching brand style
Pause for edits."

### 8. Wrap-up
"Session summary:
- Approved items: [title + channel + goal]
- Risks to verify: [list]
- Next actions for VA/designer: [who does what]

Log these hooks/topics as 'used' with today's date."

## Channel Formatting Rules

- **LinkedIn text**: 120-220 words, hook in first 2 lines, 1 CTA, ≤3 hashtags
- **Carousel/Infographic**: 6-10 slides/sections, visual hierarchy, one idea per slide
- **PDF guide**: 8-14 pages, executive summary, clear sections, visual breaks
- **Blog**: 700-900 words, answer-first summary, H2/H3, 3-5 FAQs, slug + meta
- **Quote graphic**: One powerful line, speaker attribution, brand colors
- **YouTube description**: Hook, natural keywords, timestamped chapters, CTA
- **Newsletter**: Subject + preview, lead story, 1-2 supporting sections, one CTA

## ICE Scoring Guidelines

- **Impact (0-10)**: Directly advances buyer to action; +2 if BOFU (addresses objection/offer)
- **Confidence (0-10)**: Can defend the claims made; clear examples 7-9; opinion 4-6
- **Ease (0-10)**: Ready with light edit 8-10; needs design 5-7; heavy research 2-4
