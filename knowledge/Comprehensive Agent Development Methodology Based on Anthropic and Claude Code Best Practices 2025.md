# Comprehensive Agent Development Methodology Based on Anthropic and Claude Code Best Practices 2025

## Overview

This document provides a deep analysis and comprehensive methodology for creating AI agents based on primary principles and best practices from Anthropic and Claude Code. The methodology emphasizes safety, transparency, and effectiveness in agent design and implementation.

## üéØ Core Development Principles

### 1. Constitutional AI Approach
- **Principle**: Create agents based on clear ethical principles and behavioral rules
- **Implementation**: Embed an agent "constitution" with explicit constraints and objectives
- **Safety**: Use RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) for self-correction

### 2. Anthropic's Three Pillars
1. **Simplicity**: Start with the minimal viable solution
2. **Transparency**: Clearly display the agent's planning process
3. **Quality ACI** (Agent-Computer Interface): Thorough tool documentation and testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Patterns

### 1. Prompt Chaining
```
Task ‚Üí Decomposition ‚Üí Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Result
```
- Decompose complex tasks into sequential stages
- Each LLM call processes the output of the previous one
- Increase accuracy by simplifying individual tasks

### 2. Routing
```
Input ‚Üí Classification ‚Üí Specialized Agent ‚Üí Result
```
- Direct requests to specialized agents
- Minimize the scope of responsibility for each LLM
- Separation of concerns between agents

### 3. Orchestrator-Workers
```
Central LLM ‚Üê ‚Üí Worker Agents ‚Üí Result Synthesis
```
- Dynamic task breakdown by central agent
- Parallel work by specialized executors
- Flexibility in handling unpredictable tasks

### 4. Parallelization
- **Sectioning**: Split into independent subtasks
- **Voting**: Multiple runs to get diverse outputs

## üîß MCP Integration Strategy

### Key Components
1. **Transport Mechanisms**:
   - Local stdio servers
   - Remote SSE servers  
   - Remote HTTP servers

2. **Scope Levels**:
   - Local: Personal configurations
   - Project: Team configurations
   - User: Cross-project utilities

3. **Security**:
   - OAuth 2.0 support
   - Environment variable management
   - Infrastructure within firewall

### MCP Best Practices 2025
- **Security First**: Keep MCP servers within your infrastructure for sensitive data
- **Leverage Existing Servers**: Use pre-built MCP servers before creating custom ones
- **Modular Design**: Build composable agents that can be easily extended
- **Tool Filtering**: Control which tools are available to specific agents
- **Standard SDKs**: Use official Python or TypeScript implementations

## üìã Step-by-Step Agent Creation Methodology

### Phase 1: Planning and Analysis
1. **Define Task Type**:
   - Workflow: Predefined code paths
   - Agent: Dynamic process control

2. **Choose Architectural Pattern**:

   - Complex tasks ‚Üí Orchestrator-Workers

### Phase 2: Design
1. **Create Agent Constitution**:
   - Ethical principles
   - Behavioral constraints
   - Goals and objectives

2. **Design Tools**:
   - Clear API documentation
   - Error handling
   - Security mechanisms

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Start Simple**:
   - Direct LLM API calls
   - Minimal complexity
   - Gradual enhancement

2. **Implement MCP Integration**:
   - Connect to external services
   - Standardized protocols
   - Modular architecture

### Phase 4: Testing and Evaluation
1. **Early Testing**:
   - Small samples
   - Rapid iterations
   - Dramatic improvements possible

2. **Sandbox Testing**:
   - Controlled environments
   - Security validation
   - Risk prevention

## üéõÔ∏è Claude Code Integration

### Built-in Slash Commands
```bash
/review  # Code review
/clear   # Clear history
/help    # Help documentation
/model   # Change model
```

### Custom Commands
- Stored in `.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/`
- Support arguments and file references
- Configurable via frontmatter

### MCP Slash Commands
```bash
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name>
```
- Dynamically discovered from connected servers
- Server-defined arguments support

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Token Management
- Agents: ~4√ó more tokens than chat
- Multi-agent systems: ~15√ó more tokens than chat
- Prompt caching: Up to 90% cost savings, 85% latency reduction

### Context Management
- Limit: 200,000 tokens per context
- Each subtask = separate context
- Parallel processing of large volumes

### 2025 API Improvements
- Extended 1-hour TTL for prompt caching (12√ó improvement)
- Code execution tool
- Files API
- MCP connector capabilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Control

### Human Oversight Framework
- Balance autonomy with control

- Visibility into agent problem-solving

### Constitutional Safeguards
- Classifiers for abuse detection
- Protection against prompt injection
- Multi-layered security system
- Constitutional classifiers for jailbreak robustness

### Safety Requirements
- Extensive testing in sandboxed environments
