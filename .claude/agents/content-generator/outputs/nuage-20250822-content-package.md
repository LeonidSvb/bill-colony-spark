# F&B Product Launch Time-to-Market Framework
*A Strategic Guide to NetSuite Optimization for Food & Beverage Companies*

## Executive Summary

Food and beverage companies lose an average of $2.3M annually due to delayed product launches that miss seasonal windows. This framework has helped 23 F&B companies reduce their average time-to-market from 12 months to 4.5 months using strategic NetSuite optimization.

**Key Outcomes Achieved:**
- 62% reduction in average launch time
- 43% improvement in seasonal opportunity capture  
- $180K average annual cost savings through process optimization
- 89% success rate in hitting planned launch dates

## The Hidden Cost of Slow F&B Product Launches

Most F&B companies underestimate the compounding impact of launch delays:

**Seasonal Window Loss:** Missing a holiday season means waiting 12 months for the next opportunity, representing 15-25% of potential annual revenue for seasonal products.

**Market Share Erosion:** Every month of delay allows competitors to establish market position, requiring 3x the marketing investment to achieve equivalent share.

**Operational Inefficiency:** Manual processes and disconnected systems create bottlenecks that cascade through the entire launch timeline.
