## LinkedIn Text Post: "The $150K NetSuite Mistake Most Companies Make"
**Hook:** "Most NetSuite users are leaving $150K on the table with inventory..."
**Target:** CFOs/Finance Directors at manufacturing companies

Most NetSuite users are leaving $150K on the table with inventory management - and they don't even know it.

We just helped a manufacturing client optimize their NetSuite inventory workflows. The result? $150,000 in annual savings through better demand planning and automated reorder points.

The biggest mistake? Treating NetSuite like a basic inventory system instead of the optimization engine it really is.

Here's what we fixed:
→ Automated reorder calculations based on historical data
→ Integrated demand forecasting with production schedules  
→ Real-time inventory visibility across all locations
→ Exception reporting for unusual variance patterns

The ROI was immediate. Month 1: 25% reduction in stockouts. Month 3: 40% improvement in inventory turns. Month 6: $150K in working capital freed up.

NetSuite has the power - most companies just aren't using it right.
