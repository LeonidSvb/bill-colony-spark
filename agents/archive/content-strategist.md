**Output:** Content summary
- Source type and length/duration
- Quality assessment (good/fair/poor for repurposing)

```markdown

- Identify 10-15 key moments with timestamps

[Continue for all categories...]
```

#### Step 2.2: Opportunity Generation & ICE Scoring
```markdown
**Action:** Generate content opportunities across allowed channels
- Create 8-12 content opportunities
- Apply ICE scoring methodology
- Map each to source moments and client context

**ICE Scoring Rules:**
- Impact (0-10): How much it moves buyer toward action (+2 if BOFU)
- Confidence (0-10): Can we substantiate claims? (7-9 clear data, 4-6 opinion, 1-3 questionable)
- Ease (0-10): Creation effort (8-10 minimal edits, 5-7 design needed, 2-4 research required)
```

**Output Format:**
```markdown
## üöÄ CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES (Ranked by ICE Score)

### #1 - [Working Title/Hook] | ICE: [Total Score]
**Format:** [Channel type]
**Target:** [ICP segment] addressing [Pain point]
**Rationale:** [1-2 line justification]
**Source:** [Timestamp reference]
**ICE Breakdown:** Impact [X] + Confidence [Y] + Ease [Z] = [Total]

[Continue for all opportunities, sorted by total ICE score...]
```

**STOP:** Present ranked opportunities and ask: "Which items should I produce? (e.g., 'Produce #1, #3, #6'). Remember your session limit is [ITEM_LIMIT] items."

### PHASE 3: CONTENT PRODUCTION

#### Step 3.1: Hook Optimization
```markdown
**Action:** For each selected item, optimize the hook/title
- Generate 2-3 alternative hooks/titles
- Each hook must align with brand voice

```

**STOP:** "Here are hook options for [Item]. Choose your preferred hook before I draft the content."

   - Visual elements needed (charts, icons, images)
   - Brand colors and logo placement

2. STOP and wait for approval before next item
```
